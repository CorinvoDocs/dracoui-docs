## What is a design system

A design system is a set of guidelines, standards, assets, and processes to help organizations design, build, and deploy products rapidly and consistently.

Design systems are often equated with a UI kit or component library. In reality, an effective design system spans the entire lifecycle of a product, from ideation to iteration and everything in between.
